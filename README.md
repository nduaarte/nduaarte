<br/>

<p>
  I’m a <strong>Mobile Developer</strong> specialized in building high-quality applications using <strong>React Native</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and modern frontend tooling.  
  With a strong foundation in JavaScript, I focus on writing clean, scalable and maintainable code — prioritizing performance, simplicity and long-term readability.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond mobile, I also work with <strong>Python automation</strong>, creating intelligent bots and scripts that interact with interfaces, analyze patterns and execute workflows automatically.  
  I love exploring ways to optimize processes, reduce friction and enhance user experience through thoughtful engineering.
